                Automation is revolutionizing the way law enforcement works, and with drone technology popping up all 
                over the world, law enforcement has a lot to gain from using these unmanned aerial vehicles. Police 
                departments all over the US are quickly using drones to help keep their officers safe. Drones give 
                real-time info from the air that can help them make better decisions in dangerous situations like 
                chasing after a suspect or quickly processing an accident scene. They can also create maps of popular 
                places like schools and malls that could be targeted if an active shooter were to emerge. Plus, drones 
                can get into dangerous places that can't be accessed by cops, like buildings that have been blown up or 
                areas with active shooters. And they can help police navigate their responses to emergencies and find 
                people who need help.

                Visual assessment is obviously a laborious and time-consuming process that requires a lot of effort all 
                night long. Drones' built-in capabilities allow them to perform airborne inspections with ease. Data is 
                gathered through drone surveillance with rapid, reliable, and consistent results. Deployment of drones 
                during night operations saves time and resources.

                As mentioned above, law enforcement can benefit greatly from drone deployment. Not only during the day 
                but with advanced lens and thermal imaging drones can prevent crime, report incidents and locate criminals 
                more quickly than humans. Drones' capabilities extend beyond crime detection to include natural disasters 
                that happen at night, like forest fires.

            <p></p>Keeping public infrastructure safe and efficient is essential, as dangerous conditions can lead to 
            tragedy and damage other assets. It's no secret that roads determine a nation's development rate, so it's 
            important to keep them in good condition. But it can be expensive to maintain them, so technological solutions 
            can help. Drone technology can be used to keep an eye on roads as they're being built, and it can help prevent 
            fractures and other issues. Workers can use drones to create essential infrastructure, as they can 3D model 
            roads, collect data from UAVs, and take amazing aerial photos. Drones' cameras and sensors can get really 
            detailed shots, especially in places where it's hard to get to. This helps keep the public safe and secure.

            <p>Firefighters are in a tough spot when it comes to fighting fires, but drones can help make the job safer 
                and more efficient. By collecting data remotely about an active fire, they can figure out how it's 
                burning, if anyone is still inside, and other important details. One way drones are making the job safer 
                is by helping them find victims who need to be rescued. This is especially important for structure fires, 
                where looking for people can be dangerous. A drone can fly over a building or other area that's not 
                accessible to humans, and use aerial thermography to spot smoldering areas that can't be seen with the 
                naked eye. This data can help keep the firefighter safe by avoiding the more dangerous areas of an active fire.
                Drones are also aiding in the safety of firefighting personnel by assessing the potential danger of entering a 
                burning structure or other structure. By utilizing indoor drones, firefighting personnel can evaluate the 
                likelihood of building collapse prior to entry and identify potentially hazardous hot spots through aerial 
                thermography that may not otherwise be visible. This contributes to the safety of the firefighting personnel 
                and enhances their effectiveness.

            <p>Emergency management workers like EMTs and paramedics, as well as search and rescue teams, benefit from the use 
                of drones. While they may not use them as often, they still see major safety benefits.

                Drones make it easier for first responders to locate missing people. For example, if a person has been thrown 
                out of a car in the middle of the night, or if they have not returned from a hike, it can be dangerous for first 
                responders to search for them. With the help of a thermal drone, first responders can quickly locate missing people 
                without having to hike through unfamiliar terrain in the dark.
                
                Emergency management workers also benefit from drone deliveries. During an emergency, medical personnel can use 
                drones to deliver medical supplies and other essential materials. This can help prevent EMTs from exposing 
                themselves to potentially hazardous situations. For example, during the height of COVID-19, medical personnel 
                were able to use drones to deliver food and medical supplies from a safe distance.</p>
